<!-- Responsive Web Design Principles: Use a Retina Image for Higher Resolution Displays
The simplest way to make your images properly appear on High-Resolution Displays,
such as the MacBook Pros "retina display" is to define their width and height values as only half of what the original file is.

<style>
  img { height: 250px; width: 250px; }
</style>
<img src="coolPic500x500" alt="A most excellent picture">

Pixel density is an aspect that could be different on one device from others and this density is known as Pixel Per Inch(PPI) or Dots Per Inch(DPI).
The most famous such display is the one known as a "Retina Display" on the latest Apple MacBook Pro notebooks, and recently iMac computers.
Due to the difference in pixel density between a "Retina" and "Non-Retina" displays,
some images that have not been made with a High-Resolution Display in mind could look "pixelated" when rendered on a High-Resolution display.
